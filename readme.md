<summary><h2>Installation</h2></summary>

### Pre-Installation
For the Installation of Dying Breath you must use the most recent version of Fallout 4 on steam and download all DLC's (expect the Hi-res Texture Pack)

**This is only a requirment for the first install not when updating.**

#### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

 Please make sure you have the latest Visual C++ installed. 
 [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 

#### Cleaning Fallout 4

Please uninstall Fallout 4 through Steam and delete the documents folder typically located at "Drive"\Documents\My Games\Fallout4. Once this is finished you may reinstall Fallout 4 and all included DLC's
**(This list uses a stock game folder and will download the correct versions of all files)**

#### Starting Fallout 4

After Reinstalling Fallout 4 make sure to run the Game atleast once for the Graphics Check, hit play, and load the game to the main menu before closing and starting Wabbaajack

### Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Download the latest version of Wabbajack [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a folder when unzipping at a root location such as **C:\Wabbajack** (This is the recommended installation method according to the wiki)

#### Download and Installation

The Process itself can take a while to speed this up you can put all files on an SSD (This is the reccomened and intended installation method for Dying Breath anyway.)

_STILL WRITING INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO INSTALL WITH WABBAJACK_
**(These are from the WIKI https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Installing%20a%20Modlist.html)**

    Open Wabbajack and Navigate to the Gallery
    Decide on a List to install
    Click the download button
    Wait for the first download of the .wabbajack file to finish
    When it is done click the play button where previously you had the download button
    Open and read the specific readme of the list you are about to install
    Download any third-party or external files before attempting to install the list
    Select the paths for where the list should be installed
        Installation Location: The location where the files required to play will be installed to
            Can't be set to Wabbajack's Location
            Can't be set to Game Location
            Can't be the same as another list (lists can't be merged)
            Can't be in a Windows OS managed folder (Examples include Program Files, Downloads, and the Desktop)
    Download Location: The location where the downloaded archives are stored.
        Can share the same location as the downloads folders of other lists (avoids duplicate downloads)
        Don't merge download locations if you plan to create and share your own modlists, because Wabbajack can't really differentiate which archives are the ones it needs and which just have similar files.
    Wait till Wabbajack is done
    Go back to the readme (which will open automatically) and complete any final steps mentioned there


#### Problems with Wabbajack

If you recieve lots of errors while downloading please relogin into Nexus through wabbajack and restart the application before requesting support from anywhere.

#### Could not download...

If you have issues with files not downloading, manually download the files and drop them inside of the Download folder, then re-run Wabbajack. When Wabbajack detects the correct file it will resume installation.

### Saving on disk space ***(Highly OPTIONAL)***

You may delete the downloads folder in the location you set during installion to save space. 
**The only downside is when updating in the future you will have to redownload every mod.** 

### How to start up Dying Breath

Once the installation is complete open the output folder and lauch **_ModOrganizer.exe_**. Check the top right corner and make sure "Dying Breath" is listed in the dropdown and click **_RUN_**
_Always run Dying Breath through Mod Organizer_

Once you've made a new character you will set your name and choose your appropriate stats. Select **YES** on the popup to wait for workshop to finish setting up _(This is to allow time for scripts to run)_. You will then have a short intro coming out of the vault.

Next set up your MCM Settings. 

### IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Hit ESC to open the MENU and select the option **MCM Settings**. There may be a short delay while the settings a caching after that loads select the MCM settings manager and apply a preset. (I personally recommend the 3090 Hud)
When finished Save, Load, and you may begin.
